# Deck
# Create a Deck class and an accompanying test file with the following instance methods:

# initialize: this method will take one argument - an array of cards.
# cards: an attr_reader to read the @cards attribute
# rank_of_card_at: this method will take one argument that represents the index location of a card to be used (typically 0 or 2 more on this later ðŸ˜‰ ) and will return the rank of that card.
# high_ranking_cards: this method will return an array of cards in the deck that have a rank of 11 or above (face cards and aces)
# percent_high_ranking: this method will return the percentage of cards that are high ranking
# remove_card: this method will remove the top card from the deck
# add_card: this method will add one card to the bottom (end) of the deck
